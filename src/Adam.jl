    update!(w,g,p::Adam)

Container for parameters of the Adam optimization algorithm used by
[`update!`](@ref).

Adam is one of the methods that compute the adaptive learning rate. It
stores accumulated gradients (first moment) and the sum of the squared
of gradients (second).  It scales the first and second moment as a
function of time. Here is the update formulas:

    m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * g
    v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * g .* g
    mhat = m ./ (1 - beta1 ^ t)
    vhat = v ./ (1 - beta2 ^ t)
    w = w - (lr / (sqrt(vhat) + eps)) * mhat

where `w` is the weight, `g` is the gradient of the objective function
w.r.t `w`, `lr` is the learning rate, `m` is an array with the same
size and type of `w` and holds the accumulated gradients. `v` is an
array with the same size and type of `w` and holds the sum of the
squares of the gradients. `eps` is a small constant to prevent a zero
denominator. `beta1` and `beta2` are the parameters to calculate bias
corrected first and second moments. `t` is the update count.

If `vecnorm(g) > gclip > 0`, `g` is scaled so that its norm is equal
to `gclip`.  If `gclip==0` no scaling takes place.
